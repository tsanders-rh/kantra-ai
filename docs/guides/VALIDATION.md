# Validation Results

**Goal:** Prove AI can fix Konveyor violations at >60% success rate and reasonable cost.

## Test Results

### Test Run #1 - [Date]

**Provider:** Claude Sonnet 4 / GPT-4 / etc.

| Violation Type | Count | Success | Failed | Avg Cost | Notes |
|----------------|-------|---------|--------|----------|-------|
| javax → jakarta | 1 | 0 | 0 | $0.00 | Not tested yet |
| | | | | | |

**Summary:**
- Total violations tested: 0
- Success rate: 0%
- Total cost: $0.00
- Average cost per fix: $0.00

**Findings:**

## Success Rate by Violation Type

Track which violation types AI handles well:

| Violation Type | Tested | Success | Success % | Avg Cost |
|----------------|--------|---------|-----------|----------|
| Package rename (javax → jakarta) | 0 | 0 | 0% | $0.00 |
| API migration | 0 | 0 | 0% | $0.00 |
| Annotation updates | 0 | 0 | 0% | $0.00 |
| Configuration changes | 0 | 0 | 0% | $0.00 |
| Complex refactoring | 0 | 0 | 0% | $0.00 |

## Provider Comparison

| Provider | Tested | Success Rate | Avg Cost | Avg Time | Notes |
|----------|--------|--------------|----------|----------|-------|
| Claude Sonnet 4 | 0 | 0% | $0.00 | 0s | |
| Claude Opus 4 | 0 | 0% | $0.00 | 0s | |
| GPT-4 | 0 | 0% | $0.00 | 0s | |
| GPT-3.5 | 0 | 0% | $0.00 | 0s | |

## Decision Point

**Target:** >60% success rate at <$0.15 per fix

**Current:** X% success rate at $X.XX per fix

**Status:** ⏳ In Progress / ✅ Target Met / ❌ Not Viable

**Next Steps:**
- [ ] Test on more violations
- [ ] Try different providers
- [ ] Adjust prompting strategy
- [ ] Document common failure patterns

## Common Failure Patterns

Document what causes AI to fail:

1. **Pattern:** Description
   - Example violation ID
   - Why it failed
   - Potential solution
