      explanation: This phase focuses on removing deprecated properties that have been completely removed from PatternFly v6. These are straightforward deletions with clear migration paths - removing spaceItems, labelOff, widths, alignment, and isSelected properties. While numerous (25+ incidents), each fix is simple and low-risk.

      explanation: This phase handles property replacements and component updates that require substituting one property for another or removing theme-related properties. Includes replacing 'spacer' with 'gap', removing PageSidebar theme properties, removing ToolbarItem widths, and removing ExpandableSection isActive props. These changes are more complex than simple deletions but still have clear migration patterns.
